=== New notes ===

A few things to consider with regards to workflow.

The goal of this project is to simplify and shorten the process of creating effective shell scripts for general use.


What kind of features would I want to have?

--Import common functionality, like usage, welcome mesage, exit codes, version

--Formatted meta-data about scripts

--Immediate high level of abstraction when creating new scripts

--Little clutter in script files

--As little repetition as possible

--as easily readable as writable i.e. the scripts in prod/ would contain all used imported functions and their accompanying documentation


What would the workflow look like
